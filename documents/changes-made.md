# Security Remediation Changes Report

**Repository:** nfroze/Project-11-MCP-Powered-IaC-Security-Remediation  
**Date:** July 24, 2025  
**Purpose:** Document all security fixes applied to main.tf

## Overview

This report details all changes made to remediate the critical and high severity security findings identified by Checkov. The fixed configuration maintains the same AWS resource structure while implementing security best practices.

## Critical Security Fixes Applied

### 1. RDS Database Security Enhancements

#### Removed Hardcoded Password (CKV_AWS_17)
**Before:**
```hcl
password = "changeme123!"  # Hardcoded password
```

**After:**
```hcl
# Generate secure random password
resource "random_password" "db" {
  length  = 16
  special = true
}

# Store in AWS Secrets Manager
resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret" "db_password" {
  name_prefix = "rds-password-"
  description = "Password for RDS MySQL instance"
}

# Use generated password
password = random_password.db.result
```

#### Enabled Storage Encryption (CKV_AWS_16)
**Before:**
```hcl
storage_encrypted = false
```

**After:**
```hcl
storage_encrypted = true
```

### 2. S3 Bucket Security Improvements

#### Enabled Public Access Blocks (CKV_AWS_53-56)
**Before:**
```hcl
block_public_acls       = false
block_public_policy     = false
ignore_public_acls      = false
restrict_public_buckets = false
```

**After:**
```hcl
block_public_acls       = true
block_public_policy     = true
ignore_public_acls      = true
restrict_public_buckets = true
```

#### Added Access Logging (CKV_AWS_18)
**New additions:**
- Created dedicated S3 bucket for logs
- Configured bucket logging with proper ACLs
- Added logging configuration to main data bucket

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket_logging" "data" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.data.id
  target_bucket = aws_s3_bucket.logs.id
  target_prefix = "access-logs/"
}
```

#### Added Encryption Configuration
**New addition:**
```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration" "data" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.data.id
  rule {
    apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
      sse_algorithm = "AES256"
    }
  }
}
```

## High Severity Fixes Applied

### 1. RDS Backup Configuration (CKV_AWS_133)
**Before:**
```hcl
backup_retention_period = 0
```

**After:**
```hcl
backup_retention_period = 7  # 7-day retention
```

### 2. S3 Versioning Enabled (CKV_AWS_21)
**New addition:**
```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket_versioning" "data" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.data.id
  versioning_configuration {
    status = "Enabled"
  }
}
```

### 3. Security Group Restrictions (CKV_AWS_23, CKV_AWS_260)

#### Replaced Overly Permissive Security Group
**Before:**
```hcl
resource "aws_security_group" "wide_open" {
  ingress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
```

**After:**
Created two separate, restrictive security groups:

1. **Web Security Group:**
   - HTTPS (443) from VPC only
   - HTTP (80) from VPC only
   - SSH (22) from management subnet only
   - All rules include descriptions

2. **RDS Security Group:**
   - MySQL (3306) from web security group only
   - No direct internet access

### 4. IAM Policy Restrictions (CKV_AWS_63)

#### Removed Wildcard Permissions
**Before:**
```hcl
resource "aws_iam_policy" "admin" {
  policy = jsonencode({
    Statement = [{
      Effect   = "Allow"
      Action   = "*"
      Resource = "*"
    }]
  })
}
```

**After:**
```hcl
resource "aws_iam_policy" "s3_access" {
  policy = jsonencode({
    Statement = [{
      Effect = "Allow"
      Action = [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ]
      Resource = [
        aws_s3_bucket.data.arn,
        "${aws_s3_bucket.data.arn}/*"
      ]
    }]
  })
}
```

## Additional Infrastructure Changes

### 1. Network Architecture
- Added proper subnet configuration for RDS (Multi-AZ requirement)
- Created DB subnet group with subnets in different availability zones
- Added dedicated subnet for web tier

### 2. RDS Configuration
- Changed `publicly_accessible` from `true` to `false`
- Added proper VPC security group assignment
- Added DB subnet group for proper VPC placement

### 3. Resource Naming
- Changed names from "vulnerable-*" to "secure-*" to reflect improvements
- Added descriptive tags to all resources

### 4. Added Outputs
- Database password secret ARN (marked as sensitive)
- S3 bucket name for reference

## Security Improvements Summary

| Component | Before | After | Impact |
|-----------|---------|--------|---------|
| RDS Password | Hardcoded | Secrets Manager | Prevents credential exposure |
| RDS Encryption | Disabled | Enabled | Protects data at rest |
| RDS Backup | 0 days | 7 days | Enables disaster recovery |
| RDS Access | Public | Private | Prevents internet exposure |
| S3 Public Access | Allowed | Blocked | Prevents data leaks |
| S3 Versioning | Disabled | Enabled | Enables recovery |
| S3 Logging | Disabled | Enabled | Provides audit trail |
| Security Groups | Allow all | Restrictive | Implements least privilege |
| IAM Policy | Wildcard (*) | Specific actions | Reduces blast radius |

## Deployment Considerations

1. **RDS Encryption**: Cannot be enabled on existing instances. You must:
   - Create a snapshot of the current database
   - Restore to a new encrypted instance
   - Update application connection strings

2. **Password Rotation**: After deployment:
   - The old hardcoded password should be rotated immediately
   - Update all applications to retrieve password from Secrets Manager

3. **Security Group Changes**: 
   - Test in staging first as restrictive rules may break existing connections
   - Adjust CIDR blocks based on your actual network topology

4. **S3 Bucket Changes**:
   - Enabling versioning will increase storage costs
   - Consider lifecycle policies for version management

## Remaining Recommendations

While not addressed in this fix (medium severity), consider:
1. Enabling VPC Flow Logs
2. Implementing EC2 IMDSv2
3. Using encrypted EBS volumes
4. Enabling RDS Multi-AZ for high availability
5. Implementing proper IAM roles for EC2 instances

## Compliance Impact

These changes help meet compliance requirements for:
- **PCI DSS**: Encryption at rest, access controls, audit logging
- **HIPAA**: Data encryption, access management, audit trails
- **SOC 2**: Security controls, monitoring, access restrictions
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management
